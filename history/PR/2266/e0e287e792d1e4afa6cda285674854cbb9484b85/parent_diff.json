ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be called from an ECMAScript program.</p>\n  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting language, but has become widely used as a general-purpose programming language. A <em>scripting language</em> is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is said to provide a <emu-xref href=\"#host-environment\"><a href=\"#host-environment\">host environment</a></emu-xref> of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and non-professional programmers.</p>\n  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be a <em>Web scripting language</em>, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of <emu-xref href=\"#host\"><a href=\"#host\">host</a></emu-xref> environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular <emu-xref href=\"#host-environment\"><a href=\"#host-environment\">host environment</a></emu-xref>.</p>\n  <p>ECMAScript usage has moved beyond simple scripting and it is now used for the full spectrum of programming tasks in many different environments and scales. As the usage of ECMAScript has expanded, so have the features and facilities it provides. ECMAScript is now a fully featured general-purpose programming language.</p>\n  <p>Some of the facilities of ECMAScript are similar to those used in other programming languages; in particular C, Java&#8482;, Self, and Scheme as described in:</p>\n  <p>ISO/IEC 9899:1996, <i>Programming Languages &#8212; C</i>.</p>\n  <p>Gosling, James, Bill Joy and Guy Steele. <i>The Java<sup>&#8482;</sup> Language Specification</i>.
