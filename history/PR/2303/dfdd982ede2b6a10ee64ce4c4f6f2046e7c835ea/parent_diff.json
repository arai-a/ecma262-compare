A <em>scripting language</em> is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is said to provide a <emu-xref href=\"#host-environment\"><a href=\"#host-environment\">host environment</a></emu-xref> of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language.

ECMAScript is now used to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of <emu-xref href=\"#host\"><a href=\"#host\">host</a></emu-xref> environments.
